This app is Django application Without Rest api.

API: Application programming Interface.
Cleint app wants to communicate with django app, for this we need to provide an interface
so that they can communicate with each other.
One app wants to communicate two another app we need API.
Interoperability

1)web api/web services:
    Develop api for this web app
    Service provided by web application over web by using HTTP protocol
    http://128.0.0.1:8000/api/1/  etc. api only
    Python app can send request and get response from django app.(python app can use the service provided by django app.)

2)Rest api
    Rest api /Restful api
    REST---Representational State Transfer Protocol.
    It is an architectural styles that provides guidelines to develope web api very easily's.
    APIs which are developed by usig REST.

3)Django Rest Framework
    DRF-severals tools to develop restful apis
    drf provides coding support to create web api.


1)To develope Django app
2)To develop django API--->so that our services can be used by other apps etc.



How to apps communicate with each other.
1)common language is http--->
2)commom message format --json (performance,lightweight)



Two types of web services are available-->
1)SOAP based web services 
2)REST restful web services json based

differnce between rest and soap

SOAP based web services(XML):
SOAP ( Simple Object Access Protocol) is a message protocol that allows distributed elements of an application to communicate.
        Protocols supported by soap: http/smtp/ftp   
        Data is more secured compared to rest based service
        It is an old concept with problems
        Soap is always xml based whcih is old nowdays
        XML is a heavy weight component(format of xml)
        xml message-->envelop with extra information so heavy weight.
        This heavy data is required to travel over the network from one to another ,so high bandwidth is there.
        parsing (xml data --readable xml data)xml data is not easy..low performance
        Implementing soap based services are complex
        WSDL(Web Services Description Language) to expose/describe web services to partner app() one common language is there
        large amout of data can be tansfered compared to restful
        more secure as compare to restful


REST: 
REpresentational State Transfer Protocol.
    Each unique url is associated with representation of an object(resouce) by using http verbs so that we can play with that object
    to get content of thios object(get), create(post),upadte(put),delete(delete)
    based on http protocol with url
    
Restful web services:(JSON)

        1)json bsed restful web services
        2)lightweight component based on the structure
        3)parsing is easy as compared to soap
        4)lightwirgt,so transfer over net is easy
        5)high performance
        6)Directly we can exposes our services using url,so no requirement of wsdl in restful
        7)Easy development
        8)Human understandable message format


        problem:
        1)less secure
        2)supports mostly or only http
        3)json form data--->Limit is there on data that can be sent using rest.


____________________________________________
Examples:
Most of the google web services are soap based
yahoo-REST
Ebay,amazone-Both
django---REST based only


______________________________________________________________________________
Django
To develope rest services djANGO  will provides module.

HTTP verbs:
to get data,add data,update data,delete data on server side we need to use httpp web methods are used
            get
            post
            put(full update)
            delete
            patch-->patches partial update
            options,head,connect,trace,lock,move etc

web service provider---->web service consumer
bmshow(consumer) <------payment gateway(provider)



This app creates own web services using pure django
________________________________________________________________
#html response cannot be understnd by client app etc thats why json response
so in rest api our response should understand by others so json
    
json(protocol for communication) module functions
dumps()--python dict to json object---json.dumps(python_data))
loads()---json data to python dict

Command-line http clients---->to send the http requests from command propmt
curl,HTTPie
pip install httpie
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
(server must be running)

Main purpose of rest api/web api--to communicate with other application obver a network by using rest architcture irrespective of language
Interoperability between software applications
api developer->make the services available to 3rd party.

send request---url pattern---127.0.0.1:8000/
endpoint===>api_json/


Mixin-->mixed in
very commnly used in django

mixin is the class in django--to provide functions /methods to the child class
to provide functionality to only child class--->not to self but child
we won't create objs for mixin class.
code resusability purpose
where " ABC



1)general mixin and @)multiple inheritance
1parent class instantiation is not recommended
1in mi --parent class instatiation is possible,instance var and methods

2)parent class contains only instance methods and not instance vars
2)multiple inheritance both

3)methods are useful only for child class
3)M I ...methods are useful for both parent and child class

4)can,t extendts other classes except object class
4) in MI it is possible

in django rest api--->mixin are used
what is mixin in django  special case of multiple inheritance
difference between MI and mixin(alone).

5------>
purpose of api,rest api,web service ,http,json,http versbs
function based views and class based views etc.
mixins:

crud db operations using web  api without rest framework.
model class


status code:
1XX--Informational
2XX---Successful
3XX---Redirection
4XX--Error page not found.--->clint side error
5XX--Server side problms--->server error

one emp---emp dict---json format fo one employee it is possible
but we have large queryset and each time covert each emp obect into dict and then into json object is not possible so serializers comes into pictures.

json_data=serializers.serialize('json',queryset)


6______________
emp_data=serialize('json',emp,fields=['ename','eno'])
#django serializer function   

serialization--python object into json
1)json module---dumps,loads etc
2)django.core.serializers import serialize-->serialize('json',obj) 
3) by using rest framework  ---todo


mixin--code reusability
parent class method is available for child class

instead of using 
    from django.core.serializers import serialize module
    json module
we can use mixin classmethods directly from .mixins.py

error or exception handling is very important in api
don't show bad error to client app directly
modelname.doesnotexists--to handle excepotion

how to add status code to response.
while sending from api app to consumer app for a api url
_______________________________________________________________________
how to use get method to get data without rest
retrive a particular record or all records
post request:

Q is it possible to dump total data ??
way->py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee
    provide employee data to the console.
    default format is json format only.
    
    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 (default behavipur json)

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 --format json

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 -- format xml

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --format json > empdata.json --indent 4

this is the way to dump data from db table into json/xml file format in the current working dirctory:

py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --format json > empdata.json --indent 4
empdata.json file will be get created in cwd

yaml file format.(Yaml Ain't markup language)
data serialixation language -used in cloud format
CommandError: Unable to serialize database: No module named 'yaml'

## to create a record  (POST method)

## disable csrf:
1.method level/function level--function based view
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exemp
@csrf_exempt
def my_view(request):
    pass
-------------------------------------------------------
2.class level (class based view)
core python form disable csrf verification.
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exemp
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorators

@methoddecorator(csrf_exemp,name='dispatch)  
#dispatchapplication for any type of request()
class Emplotyeelistviw(View)

---------------------------------------------------------
3.project level
settings.py----comment csrf middleware(not allowed)


parter app___>sending post data----django app should grap it and save it in the table
it should provide valid data(json data)

save data into db--we required ModelForm in django   forms.py

_________________________________________________
get a resource(get) and create a resource(post)
dumpdata

## update a resource (PUT)

form=EmployeeForm(emp_original_data) #create a new record
form=EmployeeForm(emp_original_data,instance=emp)  #update the existing one


## to get particular record info
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_all_emp/

## to get all records:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_all_emp/

## to create a record:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_all_emp/

## to update a resource :
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_emp/1/

## to delete a resource :
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_emp/1/

framework for web api withou rest ..with two endpoints to perform all crud operations
## actually endpoint should be one-----going to fix here


real time coding standard:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/aaa

## endpoint with url:'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api_api/' 
we can get single or multiple records 
## This is for single endpoint practice
