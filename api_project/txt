Django Rest Framework
Prereqst:
    Python
    Django

The most exiting technology.
Manditory technology.
Django application Without rest api.
It is Very very easy technology
It is very very small technology.

API:
web api/web services:
Rest api
Django Rest Framework

API:application programming interface.
purpose:general clarity--->
JAVA app wants to commiunicate with django app--->for these we required to provide the interface ,so they can communicate with django interface.

one app wants to communicate two another app we need API.

1)developed DJAngo app
2)develop django APi
---so that our services can be used by other apps etc.

Interoperability--->

web api-->develop api for this web api ..
service provided by web app over web by using http protocol

http://128.0.0.1:8000/api/1/  etc. api only

python app can send request and get response..from django
test.py
import requests
r=requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/')
data=r.json()
print(data['item1'])

Rest api restful api: 
architectural styles--guidelines to develope web api very easily's that's alll
api s which are developed by using rest

DRF-severals tools to develop restful apis
maps can be accessed from mobile using web api.
role of api.

1)common language is http--->
java(linux)---python(mac)---c#(windows)---app(linux)
2)commom message format --json (performance lightweight)

how to develope the api.
django api developers-->

drf provides coding support to create web api.
common lang--http with common message format is json format

2 types of web services are available--
1)SOAP based web services 
2)REST restful web services json based

SOAP based:
http/smtp/ftp   supported by soap
Data is more secured compared to rset based
old concept with problems
soap is always xml based whcih is old nowdays...heavy weight component
message--envelop with extra information so heavy weight
data is required to travel over the network from one to another ,so hight bandwidth is there
parsing (xml data --read xml data)xml data is not easy..low performance
implementing soap based services are complex

to expose/describe web services to parter app() one common language is there)---WSDL

__________________________________________________

REST: 
each unique url is associated with representation of an object(resouce) by using http verbs we can ply with that object
to get content of thios object(get)
crtae(post)
upadte(put)
delete(delete)
based on http protocol with url
Restful web services.

1)json bsed restful web services in,
2)lightweight component based on the structure
3)parsinmg is easy
4)so lightwirgt, transfer over net is easy
5)more performance.
6)directly we can exposes our services using url  so no req uirement of wsdl in restful
7)high performance
8)easy development
9)human understandable message format

problem:
less secure
supports mostly or only http
json form data...limit is there on data can be sent using rest.

differnce between rest and soap
____________________________________________

most of the google web services are soap based
yahoo---rest
ebay,amazone--both
django---rest based only


______________________________________________________________________________
Django
To develope rest services djANGO  will provides module.

get data,add data,update data,delete data on server side we need to use htt[p web methods are used
get ,post
put(full update) and delete
patch-->patches partial update


options,head,connect,trace,lock,move etc

web service provider---->web service consumer
bmshow(consumer) <------payment gateway(provider)

DRF--api  clauses

create own web services using pure django
________________________________________________________________
#html response cannot be understnd by java app etc thats why json response
    # so in rest api our response should understand by others so json
    
    json(protocol fpor communication) module functions
    dumps()--python dict to json object---json.dumps(emp_data))
    loads()---json data to python dict

Command line hhtp clients---->to send the http requests from command propmt
curl,HTTPie
pip install httpie
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
(server must be running)
Main purpose of rest api/web api--to communicate with other application obver a network by using rest architcture irrespective of language
Interoperability between software applications

api developer->make the services available to 3rd party.

send request---url pattern---127.0.0.1:8000/
endpoint===>api_json/


Mixin-->mixed in
very commnly used in django

mixin is the class in django--to provide functions /methods to the child class
to provide functionality to only child class--->not to self but child
we won't create objs for mixin class.
code resusability purpose
where " ABC



1)general mixin and @)multiple inheritance
1parent class instantiation is not recommended
1in mi --parent class instatiation is possible,instance var and methods

2)parent class contains only instance methods and not instance vars
2)multiple inheritance both

3)methods are useful only for child class
3)M I ...methods are useful for both parent and child class

4)can,t extendts other classes except object class
4) in MI it is possible

in django rest api--->mixin are used
what is mixin in django  special case of multiple inheritance
difference between MI and mixin(alone).

5------>
purpose of api,rest api,web service ,http,json,http versbs
function based views and class based views etc.
mixins:

crud db operations using web  api without rest framework.
model class


status code:
1XX--Informational
2XX---Successful
3XX---Redirection
4XX--Error page not found.--->clint side error
5XX--Server side problms--->server error

one emp---emp dict---json format fo one employee it is possible
but we have large queryset and each time covert each emp obect into dict and then into json object is not possible so serializers comes into pictures.

json_data=serializers.serialize('json',queryset)


6______________
emp_data=serialize('json',emp,fields=['ename','eno'])
#django serializer function   

serialization--python object into json
1)json module---dumps,loads etc
2)django.core.serializers import serialize-->serialize('json',obj) 
3) by using rest framework  ---todo


mixin--code reusability
parent class method is available for child class

instead of using 
    from django.core.serializers import serialize module
    json module
we can use mixin classmethods directly from .mixins.py

error or exception handling is very important in api
don't show bad error to client app directly
modelname.doesnotexists--to handle excepotion

how to add status code to response.
while sending from api app to consumer app for a api url
_______________________________________________________________________
how to use get method to get data without rest
retrive a particular record or all records
post request:


Q is it possible to dump total data ??
way->py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee
    provide employee data to the console.
    default format is json format only.
    
    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 (default behavipur json)

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 --format json

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --indent 4 -- format xml

    py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --format json > empdata.json --indent 4

this is the way to dump data from db table into json/xml file format in the current working dirctory:

py manage.py dumpdata api.Employee --format json > empdata.json --indent 4
empdata.json file will be get created in cwd

yaml file format.(Yaml Ain't markup language)
data serialixation language -used in cloud format
CommandError: Unable to serialize database: No module named 'yaml'

## to create a record  (POST method)

## disable csrf:
1.method level/function level--function based view
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exemp
@csrf_exempt
def my_view(request):
    pass
-------------------------------------------------------
2.class level (class based view)
core python form disable csrf verification.
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exemp
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorators

@methoddecorator(csrf_exemp,name='dispatch)  
#dispatchapplication for any type of request()
class Emplotyeelistviw(View)

---------------------------------------------------------
3.project level
settings.py----comment csrf middleware


parter app___>sending post data----django app should grap it and save it in the table
it should provide valid data(json data)

save data into db--we required ModelForm in django   forms.py

_________________________________________________
get a resource(get) and create a resource(post)
dumpdata

## update a resource (PUT)

form=EmployeeForm(emp_original_data) #create a new record
form=EmployeeForm(emp_original_data,instance=emp)  #update the existing one


## to get particular record info
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_all_emp/

## to get all records:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_all_emp/

## to create a record:

                                                                                        all crud operations are performed using single endpoint only --->in django rest framework.               

                                                                                        only single url should be there to perform all crud operations to meet the need of real api framework

framework for web api withou rest ..with two endpoints to perform all crud operations
## actually endpoint should be one-----going to fix here


real time coding standard:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/aaa

## endpoint with url:'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api_api/' 
we can get single or multiple records 
## This is for single endpoint practice
